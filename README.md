## Overview
Understanding customer preferences and sales trends is key to making informed business decisions. In this project I have taken raw data and transformed it into a feast of insights presented through captivating charts and visualizations.

## What We Explored

### Sales Trends

The analysis starts by tracking pizza orders over time. I have created line chart and column chart that showcase the trend of orders received, Which helped identify peak sales periods and seasonal trends. Are Fridays busier than Sundays? The charts reveal the answers.

### Pizza Types

One size does not fit all when it comes to pizza. I have categorized the revenue by pizza type,  created pie chart that illustrate which pizza varieties are customer favorites. Is it the classic or the chicken lovers ? The visualizations tell the story.


### Customer Behavior

Understanding customer behavior is crucial. Through few more charts, I have examined ordering habits, including preferred days of the week and the most popular pizza sizes. Are customers ordering more during weekends or weekdays? Charts hold the answer.


## Why It Matters

This is not just about beautiful charts; it's about actionable insights. By converting raw data into visual form, it empowered the business to make data-driven decisions. Armed with these insights, organisation can optimize their menu offerings, marketing strategies, and operational efficiency to serve their customers better and continue to be their go-to choice for mouthwatering pizza.
